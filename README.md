Ever wonder how much your cargo and passenger weight affect your car's MPG? This shiny app does just that!
Enter your car's EPA estimated MPG and the weight added to the car in LBS, 
and the app calculates your car's MPG with the extra weight. 
Calculations are based on a linear model of weight~mpg with the mtcars dataset.
